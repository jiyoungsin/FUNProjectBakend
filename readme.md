# Back End Instructions :open_book:

The back end of our application is Express and MongoDB. We decided on using typescript as the language of choice instead of javascript. However, typescript will transpile this into javascript for us. This file will be generated in the "dist" inside the express-rental-backend directory. Change directories to express-rental-backend and run the command below.

```sh
npm run dev
```
